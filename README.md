# State Tree Actions

This plugin creates actions to automate execution of multiple Action Groups based on a hierarchical tree-like structure of '_states_'.  Additional Action Groups are executed for each state depending on multiple inherited '_contexts_'.  The system is vaguely analogous to hooks in software development.

Additionally the plugin creates and maintains multiple Variables that track each state for use in Schedule and/or Trigger conditions.

Please see the [wiki page](https://github.com/kmarkley/Indigo-State-Tree-Actions/wiki) for details.
